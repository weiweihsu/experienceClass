# Designing Services for Syrian Refugees

Hello, this is a team project with Nathaniel Smith, Andres Hurtado, Cegan Dodge, Jennifer Kim, and Weiwei Hsu in Undergraduate Interaction Design 4: Experience.

## Overview
An estimate of 1 million Syrians are physically injured, and roughly 80,000 need prosthetic fittings to replace limbs lost to the war.

In the Interaction Design Department at California College of the Arts, we are exploring the growing refugee crisis and how products and services might be designed and leveraged for the continued migration of millions of people.

We are looking at creating an on-the-ground training and manufacturing facility / service to actually help those who need prosthetic fittings.

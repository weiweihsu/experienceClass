# Designing Services for Syrian Refugees

Hello, this is a team project created by [Nathaniel Smith](http://nathanielsmith.io), [Andres Hurtado](https://www.andreshurtadodesign.com/), [Jennifer Kim](http://kim-jennifer.squarespace.com/about/), and [Weiwei Hsu](http://www.weiweihsu.com/#/) in Undergraduate Interaction Design 4: Experience.

## Overview
An estimate of 1 million Syrians are physically injured, and roughly 80,000 need prosthetic fittings to replace limbs lost to the war.

In the Interaction Design Department at California College of the Arts, we are exploring the growing refugee crisis and how products and services might be designed and leveraged for the continued migration of millions of people.

We are in the process of creating a universal training protocol for prosthetics fitting, with thorough considerations on the limitations refugees might have.

## Documenation

* To avoid having a design project being created behind the curtain, a [website](http://www.weiweihsu.com/syrianrefugee/) has been created to document our process and Progress
* Since the process will generate ideas on several potential final prototypes, we would like to document other design opportunities that we didn't pursue, and support those opportunities with evidence through documentation

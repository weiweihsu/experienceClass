## About the Project

An estimate of 1 million Syrians are physically injured, and roughly 80,000 need prosthetic fittings to replace limbs lost to the war.

In the Undergraduate Interaction Design Department at California College of the Arts, we are exploring the growing refugee crisis and how products and services might be designed and leveraged for the continued migration of millions of people.

## Goal

As a 13-week project, we focused on creating a platform that addresses the amputee crisis growing among [Syrian] refugees - our service enables local citizens to be trained in LIM prosthetics and provides ongoing care to refugees experiencing first-time aputations.

<!-- We are currently in the process of creating a universal training protocol that will exist in both paper and web format to help train people to fit prosthetics, with thorough considerations of the limitations refugees might face. By May 8th of 2018, we will deliver several physical and digital prototypes to help prosthetics patients to provide long-term self-care to themselves, with sufficient knowledge on prosthetics. -->

## Lessons Learned

**Nathaniel:**
At the front stage of this project, I made a declaration that if we worked all semester on a concept that didn't become real, then it was a sickening waste of time capitalizing on other people's misery to fill a portfolio. Considering the end state of this project, I feel like we have crossed over that threshold of this as a possibility. Based on all conversations that have taken place at the executive leadership level of Lim, I am confident this project will continue on and be fully realized. Stepping through the full breadth of the research, these prototypes, and especially the workshops, we have collectively (design group and company) begun the process of wrapping our heads around how to make this a reality. I hadn't prior to this experience worked on a business model canvas. Given that, I didn't feel totally confident leading this exercise in our all hands workshop with Lim. Instead, I recruited a very brilliant colleague Dane Wetschler, from the CCA DMBA program, who works on these types of models regularly. We dedicated about an hour to the exercise. Though we didn't complete this fully, we left mostly done and left Lim to create a set of questions and assumptions, they could test in the model. The net benefit of this was really thinking through how Lim hoped to interface with a program like this and what they hoped to do. I think that was as meaningful for us to move our design forward as it was for them to think through manifesting future clinics of the Lim Reach program. Additionally, having had the opportunity to speak to Jon Woods and his pioneering efforts of creating a service like this in the Congo, it is clear what the real keys to success are and for that matter are not. Having documented, designed, and breathed that all in I feel confident where this stands to continue on.

Synthesizing research is typically a very analogous process. A lot of information that came out of our interviews and and secondary research were put onto post-its for ease of organization. After categorizing those information, insights and then "How Might We" questions were created.

To document the information we had, a [page](http://www.weiweihsu.com/syrianrefugee/synthesis.html) was created so that the synthesis process is not a mysterious black box.

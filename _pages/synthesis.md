Synthesizing research is typically a very analogous process.  

<div style="width:100%">
    <div style="width:50%">A lot of information that came out of our interviews and and secondary research were put onto post-its for ease of organization.</div>
    <div style="width:50%"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/process2.jpg" style="width:100%"> </div>
</div>

<div style="width:100%">
    <div style="width:50%">We drew insights from the emerging themes and created “How Might We” questions from the opportunities that surfaces throughout the research and synthesis process..</div>

To document the information we had, a [page](http://www.weiweihsu.com/syrianrefugee/synthesis.html) was created so that the synthesis process is not a mysterious black box.

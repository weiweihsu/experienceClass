## Buckets of Information

When we took important facts from our interviews and secondary research and put them onto post-it notes, we naturally started to group them in what we thought were appropriate categories. Some of the buckets include facts revolving and culture, follow-up care and the need to think about the patient’s mobility, as well as considerations for potential partners when it comes to manufacturing, product development, personnel, and a local champion.

## Strategy

Synthesizing research is typically a very analogous process. A lot of information that came out of our interviews and secondary research were put onto post-its for ease of organization. We drew insights from the emerging themes involving cultural implications, as well as the psycho-social aspect during treatment.

We then created “How Might We” questions from the opportunities that surfaced throughout the research and synthesis process, ranging from questions that revolve around how to deal with cultural regulations and how to organize personnel based on those facts, how to advocate empathy for a type of care that is generally under-staffed, and how to create a care model that provides patients with the necessary information to take care of themselves..

To document the information we had, a [page](http://www.weiweihsu.com/syrianrefugee/synthesis.html) was created so that the synthesis process is not a mysterious black box.

## Discovery

During our discovery presentation, we went into a bit of detail about barrel bombs in order to address the need of getting prosthetics to the amputees not only because of a shortage of people, but because of the sheer amount of different injuries from these bombings. We went on to talk about the reasons why a LIM socket is different from a traditional one, due to it’s modular elements and the ability to change shape with the limb during the day. We shared key insights and nuggets we received from all of the interviews and secondary research we did.

After pointing out some possible important areas of research, we demonstrated a few design directions we had, such as providing a self-care kit for the patient, creating a mobile care unit, or establishing a psycho-social peer network.

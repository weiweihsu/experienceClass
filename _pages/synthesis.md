title:  "Synthesis"

Synthesizing research is typically a very analogous process. A lot of information that came out of our interviews and and secondary research were put onto post-its for ease of organization. We drew insights from the emerging themes and created “How Might We” questions from the opportunities that surfaces throughout the research and synthesis process.

To document the information we had, a [page](http://www.weiweihsu.com/syrianrefugee/synthesis.html) was created so that the synthesis process is not a mysterious black box.

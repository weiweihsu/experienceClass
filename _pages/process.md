# In Process Service Blue Print

This is the data version of the blue print. It needs to be pushed into the final state and could use some revising. Visit this [page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwKHqeB0SDApelY0QzNFZW5RQWM/view) to view the full version. ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/serviceblueprint.pdf)

# Prototypes

<br>
**Patient Assessment Chatbot** Assessing the patient is an important first step toward providing prosthetics care. Some amputees may benefit from using prosthetics over wheel chair, while some may not. This is a chatbot that helps the medical center to verify the patient's situation. It is also a tool used in the training process to help trainees in understanding the key components of patient assessment.

This tool is integrated into both the text message and the Facebook messenger platform.<br>

[**Study Guide**](https://invis.io/59BILS6PS)

```
- The Prosthetics Care Guide (PCG) allows trainees to review at home the lessons taught by the prosthetist in charge during the training at the Medical Center.  The lessons are divided between day one, day two, and day three of training, as well as the three week shadowing sessions offered at the end of training.  Each lesson includes subcategories of  the information taught in a simplified, and more digestible way than the physical version, yet still keeping the all the valuable content for the trainee to review.
- Trainees have to option to test their knowledge of the lessons by taking quizzes which require the trainee to review small chucks of information in the form of index cards, and answer questions about it afterwards.  
- Collab mode allows the trainee to collaboratively review the lessons with a fellow trainee in the form of charades, encouraging learning through play.  When starting, the screen will show a question for player one to read out loud to player two, and act out the answer to the question for player two to guess.

Having a dynamic database that supports immediate update will help a medical center to keep their information up to date. A simple prototype was created to demonstrate how online spreadsheets can be used as simple and collaborative databases.<br>

<!-- The research phase in most projects often hint at several different design directions, even though the team only has time to prototype one direction thoroughly. Making the research process more transparent and traceable will enable us to build on each others' work if research findings and materials well documented. As a result, the we have digitized all of our findings for the purpose of making our research process more transparent. While documenting our findings, we have also discovered the possibility of automating most of the documentation by leveraging [sheetsee.js](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/) (a client-side library for connecting Google Spreadsheets to a website and visualizing the information in tables and maps) made by [Jessica Lord](http://jlord.us/about.html). <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/workflow.jpg" style="width:100%"> -->

## Journey Map
This journey map shows the educational training experience from a local in Lebanon who will potentially become a trainee to treat Syrian refugee amputees.  The potential traineeâ€™s experiences is divided by the high-level stages of the training journey (beginning to end), the actions taken, the multiple touchpoint involve, and the possible thoughts that might generate through the journey.

## Lessons Learned

**Nathaniel:** At the front stage of this project, I made a declaration that if we worked all semester on a concept that didn't become real, then it was a sickening waste of time capitalizing on other people's misery to fill a portfolio. Considering the end state of this project, I feel like we have crossed over that threshold of this as a possibility. Based on all conversations that have taken place at the executive leadership level of Lim, I am confident this project will continue on and be fully realized. Stepping through the full breadth of the research, these prototypes, and especially the workshops, we have collectively (design group and company) begun the process of wrapping our heads around how to make this a reality. I hadn't prior to this experience worked on a business model canvas. Given that, I didn't feel totally confident leading this exercise in our all hands workshop with Lim. Instead, I recruited a very brilliant colleague Dane Wetschler, from the CCA DMBA program, who works on these types of models regularly. We dedicated about an hour to the exercise. Though we didn't complete this fully, we left mostly done and left Lim to create a set of questions and assumptions, they could test in the model. The net benefit of this was really thinking through how Lim hoped to interface with a program like this and what they hoped to do. I think that was as meaningful for us to move our design forward as it was for them to think through manifesting future clinics of the Lim Reach program. Additionally, having had the opportunity to speak to Jon Woods and his pioneering efforts of creating a service like this in the Congo, it is clear what the real keys to success are and for that matter are not. Having documented, designed, and breathed that all in I feel confident where this stands to continue on.

**Weiwei:** After a semester, I still don't think I have understood the tip of the iceberg of service design, let alone feeling comfortable with it. Hopefully there will be lots of learning happening as I proceed to decipher the surroundings. This course has been a great introduction to working on difficult issues.

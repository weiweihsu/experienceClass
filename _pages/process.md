<!-- The research phase in most projects often hint at several different design directions, even though the team only has time to prototype one direction thoroughly. Making the research process more transparent and traceable will enable us to build on each others' work if research findings and materials well documented.

As a result, the we have digitized all of our findings for the purpose of making our research process more transparent. While documenting our findings, we have also discovered the possibility of automating most of the documentation by leveraging [sheetsee.js](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/) (a client-side library for connecting Google Spreadsheets to a website and visualizing the information in tables and maps) made by [Jessica Lord](http://jlord.us/about.html).

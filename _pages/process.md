# Design Directions

- Self-care kit: The people we talked to all told us to be aware of the patient’s mobility, and to take note of the fact that most of them will not be able to come in for follow-up care. If this were to be the case for most patients, then we had the responsibility of creating a kit for the patients that would equip them with the right knowledge (and if necessary the tools) needed in order to for them to perform any follow-up care that they may need.  
- Mobile Care unit: Also going off of the idea of the patient’s mobility, we had to consider that the patient coming to the facility was not the best option, which is why we had the idea of a mobile care unit. The unit would have all the equipment necessary to perform a prosthetics fitting and would be able to travel to any location within a certain mile radius to the mobile unit’s docking station when it is not in use.
- Physical location: Partnering with a local champion, which came up in our research, was something that would be highly beneficial to the locals, as well as providing the trainees with hands-on experience and real-life situations that they may encounter during their training and professional experience.
- Psycho-social peer network: An important point that was made during the interviews was that the trainees would most likely not know how to deal with the psychological trauma these patients have gone through. Another direction we were considering was to establish a peer network where the patient would have the chance to connect with other amputee, one who would understand what they have been through and is able to empathize with them.
- Universal Training guide: Our main goal was to create a training experience for the refugees, but we knew language would be a problem. Our idea was to create a training guide that would include a universal language, whether it was through iconography or images, videos - something that allows anyone to be able to look at it and get a basic understanding of what is trying to be conveyed.

# Prototypes

<br>
**Patient Assessment Chatbot**
<br>
Assessing the patient is an important first step toward providing prosthetics care. Some amputees may benefit from using prosthetics over wheel chair, while some may not. This is a chatbot that helps the medical center to verify the patient's situation. It is also a tool used in the training process to help trainees in understanding the key components of patient assessment.

You can text the chatbot at +16193086066, and you can view the Facebook Messenger chatbot [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6wVPZACLMW7UlE3NlZ5WmdYOE0/view?usp=sharing).

This tool is integrated into both the text message and the Facebook messenger platform.<br>

**Study Guide** [Demo](https://invis.io/59BILS6PS)


- The Prosthetics Care Guide (PCG) allows trainees to review at home the lessons taught by the prosthetist in charge during the training at the Medical Center.  The lessons are divided between day one, day two, and day three of training, as well as the three week shadowing sessions offered at the end of training.  Each lesson includes subcategories of  the information taught in a simplified, and more digestible way than the physical version, yet still keeping the all the valuable content for the trainee to review.
- Trainees have to option to test their knowledge of the lessons by taking quizzes which require the trainee to review small chucks of information in the form of index cards, and answer questions about it afterwards.  
- Collab mode allows the trainee to collaboratively review the lessons with a fellow trainee in the form of charades, encouraging learning through play.  When starting, the screen will show a question for player one to read out loud to player two, and act out the answer to the question for player two to guess.

**CMS** [Demo](https://groundedclouds.github.io/Sheetsee.cms/index.html)

Having a dynamic database that supports immediate update will help a medical center to keep their information up to date. A simple prototype was created to demonstrate how online spreadsheets can be used as simple and collaborative databases.<br>

<!-- The research phase in most projects often hint at several different design directions, even though the team only has time to prototype one direction thoroughly. Making the research process more transparent and traceable will enable us to build on each others' work if research findings and materials well documented. As a result, the we have digitized all of our findings for the purpose of making our research process more transparent. While documenting our findings, we have also discovered the possibility of automating most of the documentation by leveraging [sheetsee.js](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/) (a client-side library for connecting Google Spreadsheets to a website and visualizing the information in tables and maps) made by [Jessica Lord](http://jlord.us/about.html). <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/workflow.jpg" style="width:100%"> -->

## Journey Map
This journey map shows the educational training experience from a local in Lebanon who will potentially become a trainee to treat Syrian refugee amputees.  The potential trainee’s experiences is divided by the high-level stages of the training journey (beginning to end), the actions taken, the multiple touchpoint involve, and the possible thoughts that might generate through the journey.

## Lessons Learned

**Nathaniel:**
At the front stage of this project, I made a declaration that if we worked all semester on a concept that didn't become real, then it was a sickening waste of time capitalizing on other people's misery to fill a portfolio. Considering the end state of this project, I feel like we have crossed over that threshold of this as a possibility. Based on all conversations that have taken place at the executive leadership level of Lim, I am confident this project will continue on and be fully realized. Stepping through the full breadth of the research, these prototypes, and especially the workshops, we have collectively (design group and company) begun the process of wrapping our heads around how to make this a reality. I hadn't prior to this experience worked on a business model canvas. Given that, I didn't feel totally confident leading this exercise in our all hands workshop with Lim. Instead, I recruited a very brilliant colleague Dane Wetschler, from the CCA DMBA program, who works on these types of models regularly. We dedicated about an hour to the exercise. Though we didn't complete this fully, we left mostly done and left Lim to create a set of questions and assumptions, they could test in the model. The net benefit of this was really thinking through how Lim hoped to interface with a program like this and what they hoped to do. I think that was as meaningful for us to move our design forward as it was for them to think through manifesting future clinics of the Lim Reach program. Additionally, having had the opportunity to speak to Jon Woods and his pioneering efforts of creating a service like this in the Congo, it is clear what the real keys to success are and for that matter are not. Having documented, designed, and breathed that all in I feel confident where this stands to continue on.

**Andres:**
I started off Experience class by feeling completely overwhelmed when it was communicated to us the amount of work that we would have to complete over the course of the semester; I felt it would be too much for me to handle, and at the end not be able to completely understand the overall knowledge of service design taught to us, and not be able to deliver the content that was required of us for our semester-long project.   As we completed the first individual project of re-designing a service and moved on to our research stage in our group, although still slightly skeptical of my abilities, my level of confidence slowly started rising because of the basic knowledge of identifying and creating a service that had been instructed by our professors, Christina Worsing, and Reena Al-Yassini.  Although I was interested in exploring the area of prosthetics and amputees, and merging it with the Syrian Refugee Crisis, I again started to feel like it would be too much for me to understand.  I slowly started to prove myself wrong as I started to collaboratively work with my team members, challenged myself to speak my mind out to the class and team members, and occasionally take leadership in my team’s group meetings.  Working with a partner (LIM Innovations) since the beginning of our project helped me to understand how our project could become a reality if it were to be deployed out in the real world.  At the end of our group project, I proved myself wrong in having proof that I was be able to understand the basic elements of a service, and collaboratively go through the different stages in building one.  I am confident in having the capacity, and knowledge of creating services in the future.

**Weiwei:**
This course has been a great learning experience for me to understand some of the moving parts of service design. I am now even more aware of how much more there is to learn, to sharpen, and to become fluent in. I have learned many lessons, likely more than I can recall.
